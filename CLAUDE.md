# CLAUDE.md — Project rules for Claude Code

## Ownership boundaries

- **Never** directly edit content in `synth/`, `spec/`, `repo/`, or `tex/`.
- **Only** read `extract/raw.md` to verify its contents — never write to it.
- These folders are owned by their respective agents and are only modified through the defined pipeline workflow.
